==== GateRelease1 application =================================================


1. Test of migration of debris-flow code to claw 5.x format

2. To run code:

    python makeaux.py
    python maketopo.py

    ---it is not necessary to run makedtopo.py (and it takes a long time to run)

    make new     (compile for the first time...to get modules)
    make .output (will compile and run the code).
